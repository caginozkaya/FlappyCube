# FlappyCube
It's a basic web page game, original game taken from https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_intro.asp . I added database connections to save the scores and create a leaderboard. To run it;
1) Install XAMMP.
2) Go to ../xammp/htdocs and copy index.php in this repo to here.
3) Go to ../xammp/mysql/data and unzip the scoreboard file in here.
4) Run XAMMP, start Apache and MySql.
5) Open your browser and type localhost in the url section. 
Now you can play the game, play around with the code, make some changes and test them.
If you want to check the batabase, tpye locahost/phpmyadmin.
